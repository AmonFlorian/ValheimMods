## Helheim Notes

- Create world at Helheim level, can't change existing world
- Store "Helheim" and "HelheimLevel{X}" in the GlobalKeys of the world
- If you go to a Valheim world with a character that's been in Helheim, you get Helheim Sickness for 30 minutes (?) that doesn't go away automatically, even if you come back to Helheim
- Helheim sickness gives you -80% health regen and stamina regen, and -100 carry weight
