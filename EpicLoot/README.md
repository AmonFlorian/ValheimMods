# Epic Loot

This mod aims to add a loot drop experience to Valheim similar to Diablo or other RPGs. Monsters and chests can now drop Magic, Rare, Epic, or Legendary magic items. Each magic item has a number of magic effects on it, that give bonuses to the item or your character when that magic item is equipped.

The mod is currently in Early Access! That means it's not done! Be patient as the author adds new features, fixes bugs, and finishes things up. If you want to help, please provide feedback on the [Nexus mod page](TODO) or on the [github](https://github.com/RandyKnapp/ValheimMods/tree/main/EpicLoot) page for the following subjects:

- Bugs
- Balance Issues
- Missing content (but first check the TODO list below to make sure the author isn't already planning to do it)
- Suggestions for new magic item effects
- Suggestions for other improvements

Information about EVERY magic effect and loot drop table can be found in info.md.

**Author's Note:** This mod uses an image of the Odal rune (ᛟ) to denote set items. It's reconstructed Proto-Germanic meaning is "Heritage" or "Possession" and the author felt like it was the best rune from the Elder Futhark to signify set items. However, the Odal rune with wings or feet was and is used as a Nazi symbol. The author ***UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMNS*** Nazis, Nazism, anti-semitism, and white supremacy. Furthermore, those who hold or practice those beliefs are not welcome to use this mod. Fuck Nazis.
